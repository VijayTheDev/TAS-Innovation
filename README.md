## Project-Descriptions

### Task 1: Tribute Page

This is my first project as an intern at TAS Innovation, a tribute page dedicated to Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India and a visionary leader. Using HTML and CSS, I created a responsive web page showcasing his life, achievements, and inspiring quotes. You can explore the code on GitHub and view the live demo on GitHub Pages. I'm grateful to TAS Innovation for this valuable learning opportunity. #tasinnovation #internship #tasinternship

### Task 2: Simple Portfolio Website

As an intern at TAS Innovation, I'm excited to present my second project—a simple portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. This website displays my skills, projects, and contact information. To ensure a great user experience, I employed flexbox, grid layouts, and media queries for responsiveness. Feel free to examine the code on GitHub and visit the live demo on GitHub Pages. I want to thank TAS Innovation for this fantastic learning experience. #tasinnovation #internship #tasinternship

### Task 3: Google Website Clone

I'm delighted to share my third project during my internship at TAS Innovation—a clone of the Google web page crafted with HTML and CSS. This project was a challenging endeavor, aiming to replicate the look and feel of one of the world's most popular websites. I honed my skills in using icons, fonts, and color schemes to closely match the original design. You can access the code on GitHub and explore the live demo on GitHub Pages. Many thanks to TAS Innovation for this enjoyable and rewarding project. #tasinnovation #internship #tasinternship
